# FootballWebScrape
A pilot on webscraping football data from Wikepedia tables for basic data plotting

## Background:

Attempting to flesh out my webscraping skills by pulling table data from the Premier League 2021-2022 webpage through trial and error.
Following this up by performing very basic data visualisation.

##Current State:
Able to scrape intial table on football teams and their respective stadiums. Perform very basic visualisation of the capacity of the stadiums, in order to get some experience plotting and scraping.
